+ **MarHot in #IBSVancouver2022**

Some preliminary results from MarHot were presented at the IBS Vancouver 2022, the [10th Biennial Conference of the International Biogeography Society](https://web.cvent.com/event/437755ba-3761-4eea-9c20-aca221ba457d/summary).

Results were presented during the CHANGING OCEAN ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY Symposium organized by Mary O'Connor.
