## Prospective undergrad, PhD students and postdocs

In 2024 I am starting my "Ram√≥n y Cajal" fellowship, please feel free to email me if you are interested in any [line of research](https://chefaoui.github.io/index.html#Research_Lines).

Sending your CV and a short letter explaining how our research interests could fit would be ideal.

We could attempt some of the European Union, Comunidad de Madrid, Spanish Ministry, URJC and/or IICG job opportunities.
