## Phymacro

Phymacro is an ASSEMBLE Plus Transnational Access grant in the context of the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (Grant Agreement No. 730984). 
In this project we will investigate the physiological responses of marine macrophytes to ocean warming and desiccation stress.
