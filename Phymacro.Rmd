## Phymacro   
***

Phymacro is an **ASSEMBLE Plus** Transnational Access grant in the context of the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program *(Grant Agreement No. 730984)*. 
In this project we investigated the physiological responses of marine macrophytes to ocean warming and desiccation stress.
